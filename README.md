## What's In It

Assignments, projects, and code from doing the lessons. The code from the lessons (the parts you have to read) are in folders named "part<number_here>". So, for Part 1, the code will be in "part_1/part1". Assignments and projects will be named based on the assignment's name from its start (many projects span multiple assignments).
